  <h1>Amy N Bowen</h1>
  <p>My name is Amy Bowen, and I have already completed two semesters of classes here at CCC studying Web Development and Programming. I would like to continue learning about different ways to program things, it's a little difficult to keep up with all the different programming languages, but I still enjoy it. In the future, I'd like to have a job in the field, I'm not sure where but I've been told that there are opportunities for programming work everywhere.</p>
